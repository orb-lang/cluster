# Cluster


  **The Comprehensive LUa System for Typing Everything Repeatedly**\.

Cluster is the basis for using the LuaJIT runtime in the bridge\-approved
fashion\.  It succeeds at this, insofar as it will, by respecting the existing
philosophy of the language\.

  Much as I aim to work with the latter, if Lua has a flaw, it is this, and
here we might even see the maestro cop to it\.

So as we must, we [tip our hat to Edsger Djikstra](link line not found for obelus: â€¡ on line 24), as we dive back into
the waters of Knuthian programming with Wirthian characteristics\.
